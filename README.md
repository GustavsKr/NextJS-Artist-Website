# Next.js Artist Website (In Progress)

This repository contains a **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** website for a local musician. The project is currently under development and is hosted at [https://next-js-artist-website.vercel.app/](https://next-js-artist-website.vercel.app/).

## Overview

The website aims to serve as an online presence for a local pianist/composer, with a focus on simplicity, customizability, and ease of content management. The key sections include:

- **Biography** - Editable by the musician through Supabase.
- **Gallery** - Upload and manage images through Supabase.
- **Other sections** - Upcoming: music releases, events, contact, presskit, etc.

Supabase acts as a content management backend, allowing the musician to log in and update the biography and gallery directly. This eliminates the need to modify code for content updates.
